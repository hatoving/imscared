# What is this?
IMSCARED is, as it's advertised, a "pixelated nightmare". It's a critically-acclaimed pixel horror game made by Ivan Zanotti.
This repo contains a patch made specifically for the YoYo Loader by Rinnegatamante.

# Some things I should know?
Yes. First off, the game will try to deceive you and will create files in the assets folder of the game (`ux0:data/gms/<IMSCARED HERE>/assets`)-
Be sure to check it often with a file management app like VitaShell. Another thing, **always quit the game with Select**. The game will ask you to quit the game with Select, and therefore, if you try to quit by closing the app, it won't work as the game won't progress at times.

## CONTROLS
Move - L-Stick/D-Pad
Look Around - R-Stick
Interact - Cross
Crouch - L
Run - R
Select - Pause/Quit
Misc. things - Circle/Triangle
